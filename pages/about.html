<p class="post_body">
    A former Math Education Teacher turned Chief Product Officer at <a href="https://abre.com" rel="noopener"
        target="_blank">Abre</a>, Chris is dedicated to
    revolutionizing K12 educational technology. With experience teaching Algebra and Pre-Calculus, he understands the
    challenges educators face
    and is passionate about creating solutions that enhance efficiency and improve outcomes. As a district web developer
    and
    e-learning coordinator, Chris wrote the first line of code for what would become Abre, a platform that grew to serve
    all staff, students, and families in the district. Recognized for his technical expertise and empathetic approach,
    Chris excels in building strong, collaborative relationships with colleagues and clients. As a loving husband and
    father to a 9-year-old daughter and a 6-year-old son, he treasures the time spent with his family, making memories
    and enjoying life's simple pleasures.
